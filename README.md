<img src="header.png">
Deep learning is the electricity of the twenty-first century. With the development of self-attention mechanisms, we can create powerful artificial neural network models that can learn essential morphological traits as part of their latent representation.

Using neural networks to learn the representation of strong gravitational lensing images has the potential to lead to the development of models capable of learning an embedding space with possibilities far beyond existing theories, speeding up astronomical research and significantly contributing to our understanding of the universe!
